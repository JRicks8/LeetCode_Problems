# LeetCode_Problems
This repository houses the solutions for LeetCode problems that I have solved.

The purpose of this repository is to be an effective exercise to demonstrate my consistency and problem solving abilities. 
In the spirit of this, every solution found in this repository is my own original work, and is unassisted by anything more than the documentation of the language of choice.
I do not edit my solutions after submission.
